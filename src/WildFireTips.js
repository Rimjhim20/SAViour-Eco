      <h5 class="card-title">Create Defensible Space</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Creating defensible space is a crucial step in preparing for a wildfire. This involves clearing dry leaves, debris, and flammable vegetation around your home, creating a buffer zone of at least 30 feet in all directions. This can help prevent the fire from spreading to your home and give firefighters a better chance of protecting your property.</p>
